# AI-Driven Decision Tree Solutions for Data Processing

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook focuses on AI-driven data preprocessing and classification using the ID3 decision tree algorithm. It demonstrates industry-relevant data preparation techniques such as encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and splitting data for training and testing.

## Features
- **Industrial Data Preprocessing**:
  - Label encoding using `LabelEncoder`
  - Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`
  - Splitting data into training and testing sets
- **AI-Powered Model Training & Evaluation**:
  - Implementing a decision tree classifier using the ID3 algorithm
  - Evaluating model performance with accuracy metrics for real-world applications
- **Data Visualization & Insights**:
  - Exploratory data analysis using `matplotlib`
  - Industry-oriented decision-making insights

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the notebook:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn id3
```

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
2. Run each cell sequentially to preprocess the data and train the model.
3. Modify the dataset or parameters to experiment with different configurations for industry applications.
